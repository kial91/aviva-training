/**
 * Create an interface for a footballer. This footballer has some properties. Using the information below, create a type alias or an interface:
 *
 * - Name => "Goal Hanger"
 * - Age => 30
 * - Football Club => "Norwich City F.C"
 * - Position => "Striker"
 * - Shirt number => 9
 * - Salary => 1000000
 *
 * The type or an interface should be generic.
 *
 * Using the above, now create a function which returns the shirt number of a footballer
 *
 * *BONUS*
 *
 * If you used an interface, try creating a type alias and vice versa
 *
 * Try to make use of indexed access types (see https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/indexed-access-types.html for more info)
