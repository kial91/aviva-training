# Aviva Training
JavaScript and TypeScript exercises (and solutions) for the Aviva training sessions.

### Setup
Unzip the `node_modules.zip` into the desired folder(s) of the exercise(s) you would like to work on.

Then run the following command:

```
npm run start
```

This will start a dev server (via Parcel) and automatically open a new browser tab, which you can use as a playground for your solutions.

**Changes to files are automatically applied so you don't need to restart the server.**

### Project structure
Using the `array-methods` exercise as an example, this is how your exercise folder *should* look after moving the extracted `node_modules` folder into your exercise folder:

```
 array-methods
   |-- node_modules
   |-- solution
      |-- index.js
   |-- src
      |-- index.js
   |-- .gitignore
   |-- index.html
   |-- package.json 
   |--- tsconfig.json (if TypeScript exercise)
```

### Exercises
All files related to the exercise are located under the `src` directory.

### Solutions
All files related to the exercise solution(s) are located under the `solution` directory.

### Other
`console.log()` will be your best friend during these exercises, so ensure you have the console open in your browser developer tools.
