# Aviva Training
JavaScript and TypeScript exercises (and solutions) for the Aviva training sessions.

## JavaScript
Contains a number of exercises (and their solutions) based on the topics covered in the JavaScript training session.

### Setup
Unzip the node_modules.zip into the desired folder(s) of the exercise(s) you would like to work on.

Then run the following command:

```
npm run start
```

This will start a dev server (via Parcel) and automatically open a new browser tab, which you can use as a playground for your solutions.

**Changes to files are automatically applied so you don't need to restart the server.**

### Exercises
All files related to the exercise are located under the `src` directory.

### Solutions
All files related to the exercise solution(s) are located under the `solution` directory.

### Other
`console.log()` will be your best friend during these exercises, so ensure you have the console open in your browser developer tools.
